I am Philip Ireoluwa Okiokio, you can call me Kio. I am a software engineer, actively building server-side applications, converting business logic to code. On other days I am a writer who finds inspiration in the weirdest of places.

My core Tech stack is NodeJs (Express, NestJs), however I have experince with building RESTful services with Python (Django), I also have used other tools such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Heroku, Google cloud platform, AWS EC2 Instance.

Currently building Ideas, testing waters and implimenting solutions.

I am looking to collaborate on Projects, short Gigs with respect to server-side applications in NodeJs.

I am currently looking for a Job, I have over a years experience in building server-side applications. I have in these shortly gathered experience and actively built three products for two startups.
